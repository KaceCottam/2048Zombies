## Made using [Elm](https://elm-lang.org)

An in-browser version of my new game "2048 Zombies".

## What is 2048 Zombies?

2048 Zombies is a puzzle game where the player controls zombies so that they can eat humans.  
Every movement the zombies do, the humans will also do.  
This creates a challenge in the fact that humans are always going to be running away from zombies, unless if they are cornered.

## How to play?

A playable version is hosted [here](https://KaceCottam.github.io/2048Zombies)!  
There is a very simple menu system, as well as a set of controls that the player can click on to do an action.

Walls are brown-- they cannot be surpassed by either humans or zombies.  
Humans are tan with an 'H'-- they can be eaten by zombies to give zombies +1 movement.  
Zombies are green with a 'Z' and a number in their name. This number is the amount of spaces they are allowed to move before decaying.  

You can win if all the humans are eaten, but you lose if all the zombies decay.
